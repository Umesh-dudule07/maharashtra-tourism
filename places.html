Public transport
Main article: Public transport in Mumbai
Public transport systems in Mumbai include the Mumbai Suburban Railway, Monorail, Metro, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses, black-and-yellow meter taxis, auto rickshaws and ferries. Suburban railway and BEST bus services together accounted for about 88% of the passenger traffic in 2008.[226] Auto rickshaws are allowed to operate only in the suburban areas of Mumbai, while taxis are allowed to operate throughout Mumbai, but generally operate in South Mumbai.[227] Taxis and rickshaws in Mumbai are required by law to run on compressed natural gas (CNG),[228] and are a convenient, economical, and easily available means of transport.[227]

Rail
The Mumbai Suburban Railway, popularly referred to as Locals forms the backbone of the city's transport system.[229] It is operated by the Central Railway and Western Railway zones of the Indian Railways.[230] Mumbai's suburban rail systems carried a total of 6.3 million passengers every day in 2007.[231] Trains are overcrowded during peak hours, with nine-car trains of rated capacity 1,700 passengers, actually carrying around 4,500 passengers at peak hours.[232] The Mumbai rail network is spread at an expanse of 319 route kilometres. 191 rakes (train-sets) of 9 car and 12 car composition are utilised to run a total of 2,226 train services in the city.[233]

The Mumbai Monorail and Mumbai Metro have been built and are being extended in phases to relieve overcrowding on the existing network. The Monorail opened in early February 2014.[234] The first line of the Mumbai Metro opened in early June 2014.[235]

Mumbai is the headquarters of two zones of the Indian Railways: the Central Railway (CR) headquartered at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus), and the Western Railway (WR) headquartered at Churchgate.[236] Mumbai is also well connected to most parts of India by the Indian Railways. Long-distance trains originate from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Dadar, Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Mumbai Central, Bandra Terminus, Andheri and Borivali.[237]

Bus
Mumbai's bus services carried over 5.5 million passengers per day in 2008,[226] which dropped to 2.8 million in 2015.[238] Public buses run by BEST cover almost all parts of the metropolis, as well as parts of Navi Mumbai, Mira-Bhayandar and Thane.[239] The BEST operates a total of 4,608 buses[240] with CCTV cameras installed, ferrying 4.5 million passengers daily[226] over 390 routes. Its fleet consists of single-decker, double-decker, vestibule, low-floor, disabled-friendly, air-conditioned and Euro III compliant diesel and compressed natural gas powered buses.[241] BEST introduced air-conditioned buses in 1998.[242] BEST buses are red in colour, based originally on the Routemaster buses of London.[243] Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC, also known as ST)[244] buses provide intercity transport connecting Mumbai with other towns and cities of Maharashtra and nearby states.[245][246] The Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport (NMMT) and Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) also operate their buses in Mumbai, connecting various nodes of Navi Mumbai and Thane to parts of Mumbai.[247][248]

Buses are generally favoured for commuting short to medium distances, while train fares are more economical for longer distance commutes.[249]

The Mumbai Darshan is a tourist bus service which explores numerous tourist attractions in Mumbai.[250] Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) lanes have been planned throughout Mumbai.[251] Though 88% of the city's commuters travel by public transport, Mumbai still continues to struggle with traffic congestion.[252] Mumbai's transport system has been categorised as one of the most congested in the world.[253]

Water
Water transport in Mumbai consists of ferries, hovercrafts and catamarans. Services are provided by both government agencies as well as private partners.[254] Hovercraft services plied briefly in the late 1990s between the Gateway of India and CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai. They were subsequently scrapped due to lack of adequate infrastructure.[255]

Road
Mumbai is served by National Highway 3, National Highway 4, National Highway 8, National Highway 17 and National Highway 222 of India's National Highways system.[256] The Mumbai-Pune Expressway was the first expressway built in India.[257] The Eastern Freeway was opened in 2013. The Mumbai Nashik Expressway, Mumbai-Vadodara Expressway,[258] are under construction. The Bandra-Worli Sea Link bridge, along with Mahim Causeway, links the island city to the western suburbs.[259] The three major road arteries of the city are the Eastern Express Highway from Sion to Thane, the Sion Panvel Expressway from Sion to Panvel and the Western Express Highway from Bandra to Dahisar.[260] Mumbai has approximately 1,900 km (1,181 mi) of roads.[261] There are five tolled entry points to the city by road.[262]

Mumbai had about 721,000 private vehicles as of March 2014,[263] 56,459 black and yellow taxis as of 2005,[264] and 106,000 auto rickshaws, as of May 2013.[265]

Air
The Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (formerly Sahar International Airport) is the main aviation hub in the city and the second busiest airport in India in terms of passenger traffic.[266] It handled 36.6 million passengers and 694,300 tonnes of cargo during FY 2014�2015.[267] An upgrade plan was initiated in 2006, targeted at increasing the capacity of the airport to handle up to 40 million passengers annually[268] and the new terminal T2 was opened in February 2014.[269]

The proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport to be built in the Kopra-Panvel area has been sanctioned by the Indian Government and will help relieve the increasing traffic burden on the existing airport.[270]

The Juhu Aerodrome was India's first airport, and now hosts the Bombay Flying Club and a heliport operated by state-owned Pawan Hans.[271]

Sea
Mumbai is served by two major ports, Mumbai Port Trust and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, which lies just across the creek in Navi Mumbai.[272] Mumbai Port has one of the best natural harbours in the world, and has extensive wet and dry dock accommodation facilities.[273] Jawaharlal Nehru Port, commissioned on 26 May 1989, is the busiest and most modern major port in India.[274] It handles 55�60% of the country's total containerised cargo.[275] Ferries from Ferry Wharf in Mazagaon allow access to islands near the city.[276]

The city is also the headquarters of the Western Naval Command, and also an important base for the Indian Navy.[148]

Public transport in Pune includes Pune Suburban Railway, bus services operated by PMPML and auto rickshaws. Online transport network companies such as Uber and Ola Cabs also provide rideshare and taxi services in the city. Construction of Pune Metro, an urban mass rapid transit system, is underway as of 2018.[225]

Rail
Main articles: Pune Railway Station and Pune Suburban Railway
Pune Suburban Railway (electric multiple units) (popularly called local trains) connect Pune to the industrial city of Pimpri-Chinchwad and the hill station of Lonavala. Daily express trains connect Pune to Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Nagpur, Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, Coimbatore, Bangalore, Allahabad, Kanpur, Howrah, Jammu Tawi, Darbhanga, Goa, Gwalior, Varanasi, Bhubaneswar, Ranchi, Patna, and Jamshedpur. At Pune, there is a diesel locomotive shed and an electric trip shed.[226] Pune Railway Station is administered by the Pune Railway Division of Central Railways.[227]

Local buses in Pune
Main articles: Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited and Rainbow BRTS
Public buses within the city and its suburbs are operated by Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML). PMPML operates the Rainbow BRTS system, the first of its kind in India, in which dedicated bus lanes were supposed to allow buses to travel quickly through the city. The project has turned out to be a failure, receiving little patronage from the local citizenry.[228] Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation runs buses from stations in Shivajinagar, Pune station, and Swargate to all major cities and towns in Maharashtra and neighbouring states. Private companies also run buses to major cities throughout India.[229]

Metro
Main article: Pune Metro
Pune Metro, a mass rapid transit system, is under construction and is expected to be operational by 2021.[230][231] The detailed project report was prepared for the initial two lines by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation which was approved by the State government in 2012 and by the central government in December 2016.[232][233][234] Two lines, Line 1 from Pimpri Chinchwad Muncipal Corportion Building to Swargate and Line 2 from Ramwadi to Vanaz, with a combined length of 31.25 kilometres (19.42 mi), are being constructed by MahaMetro, a 50:50 joint venture of the State and central governments.[235] Line 1 will run underground between Swargate and Range Hills be and elevated until Pimpri Chinchwad. Line 2 will be completely elevated and will intersect Line 1 at the Civil Court interchange station in Shivajinagar.[236]

Line 3 between Hinjawadi and Civil Court, Shivajinagar was approved by the state and central governments in January and March 2018, respectively.[237][238] This 23.3-km line is being implemented by PMRDA on a public-private partnership basis.[239]

Road transport

See also: Old Mumbai�Pune Highway, Dehu Road�Katraj bypass, and New Katraj Tunnel
Pune is well-connected to other cities by Indian and state highways. National Highway 4 connects it to Mumbai, Bangalore and Kolhapur. National Highway 65 to Hyderabad, Suryapet, Vijayawada and National Highway 50 to Nashik. State highways connect Pune to Ahmednagar, Aurangabad and Alandi. Pune is served by three intra-city highways: Old Mumbai�Pune Highway; Pune�Satara Highway and Dehu Road�Katraj bypass, all part of National Highway 4.

The Mumbai-Pune Expressway is India's first six-lane high-speed expressway, and it was built in 2002. Only four wheeled vehicles are allowed on it. This expressway has reduced travel time between Pune and Mumbai to a little over two hours. A ring road is planned.[240][241][242]

Two wheelers in Pune
Once known as the "cycle city of India", Pune has experienced a rapid growth in the number of motorised two wheelers replacing the bicycle.[243] In 2005 the city was reported to have one million two wheelers. The report also stated that the increase in vehicular and industrial activity had led to a 10-fold increase in particulate pollution in some areas of the city.[244] A report published in 2016 estimated the number of two wheeler users in Pune at 3.5 million.[245] In 2018 the number of vehicles in the city has exceeded its population with 3.62 million total vehicles, 2.70 million being two wheelers.[246][247] In the fiscal year 2017�18 alone 300,000 new vehicles were registered in the city, two-thirds of them two wheelers.[248]

A revival of cycling in Pune with 130 kilometres (81 mi) of cycle tracks built was attempted as a part of the BRT system under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission in 2004.
